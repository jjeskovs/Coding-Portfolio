        <p>
          I am a versatile, goal-oriented full stack web developer and graduated
          from the University of Massachusetts with B.S in Accounting and
          Finance. With work experience ranging from corporate accounting, sales
          and marketing, to owning a business with worldwide clientele. I have
          experience working independently as a contractor as well as working
          collaboratively in team environments. I'm an excellent communicator
          with intercultural sensitivity, possess effective verbal and written
          communication skills, and fluency in Russian and English. I am also a
          problem-solver who enjoys being challenged, and thrives in fast paced,
          results driven environments. I am as capable of analytical problem
          solving, business management, and cultivating relationships. I am able
          to help build a business, contribute design ideas to a team, and
          foster team development using my skills in JavaScript, React, MongoDB
          and NodeJS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have chosen to make a change and pursue a career as a web developer
          and software engineer. I have successfully finished a Full-Stack Web
          Development program from the University of Denver and am eager to
          become a part of this exciting industry for which Iâ€™m fully equipped
          with working collaboratively with a like-minded team to ensure optimal
          results for user-centered and technology-centered designs.
